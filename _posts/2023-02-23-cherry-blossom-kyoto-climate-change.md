Observations for **Cherry Blossom bloom** have been recorded in Kyoto since the 9th century. Over this period, it is difficult to see or detect a salient pattern for the day of year (DOY) of the first bloom. See Image 1-bottom. However, since the Industrial Revolution, the first bloom appears to have come earlier in the year. Image 1-top shows a zoomed-in view of the years 1880-2015, with a curve through the smoothed data points.

Concurrently, there has been a trend of increasing global temperature. The local temperature in Kyoto has also increased over the years and also for each month.

To facilitate data analysis, the "anomaly" is often used instead of the absolute measurement value. The _anomaly_ is simply the difference between the measurement value and the average over a baseline period.

Using the baseline period of 1951-1980, we compute the temperature anomaly and the first bloom day earlier than the baseline average (i.e. the negative of the first bloom anomaly).

Visual comparisons between temperature and Cherry Blossom bloom are shown in Images 2 to 4, using superimposed graphs on a standardized scale. Local in place, from the plots it is clear that the bloom day correlates more with the Kyoto temperature than with the global temperature; this is not surprising. Local in time, for the months which are closer to the bloom season (especially just before the bloom season), it is not apparent that the temperature and bloom day are more strongly correlated over the period of 1880-2015.
