**Bird Migration** over the continental U.S. can be grouped into several north-south flyways, such as the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific flyways. Another method [1] to categorize the flyways is to perform cluster analysis on the species with shared migration routes, which results in three flyways: Western, Central, and Eastern. Data on the nocturnal migration activity over these three flyways in the Spring and Fall seasons was collected by [2]. The migration activity was detected by weather surveillance radars. For each season, the _peak migration date_ can be defined as the day of year at which the cumulative detected migration activity reaches 50%. See [2] for further details.

To facilitate data analysis, the "anomaly" is often used instead of the absolute measurement value. The _anomaly_ is simply the difference between the measurement value and the average over a baseline period.

Using the baseline period of 1995-2018, we compute the temperature anomaly and the peak migration date earlier than the baseline average (i.e. the negative of the peak migration date anomaly).

Visual comparisons between temperature and bird migration are shown in Images 2 to 4, using superimposed graphs on a standardized scale. Local in place, the correlation of bird migration looks stronger with local warming than with global warming. Local in time, the Spring season looks more strongly correlated than the Fall season.  Local in both place and time, the correlation appears most strongly in the Spring Central plot.
