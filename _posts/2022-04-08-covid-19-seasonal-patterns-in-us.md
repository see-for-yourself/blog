Covid-19 occurs in surges and seasonal waves, with peaks in the autumn and winter seasons. For Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S., the radial charts below show the cyclical and seasonal changes, and trends of decreasing cases and deaths over time. The data was collected by Johns Hopkins University [1] from January 2020 to March 2023, essentially during the period of global emergency [2].
